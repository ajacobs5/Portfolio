            <p>I am a member of Perry Meridian High School's robotics team! We are Cyber Blue 234, of the First Indiana Robotics Competition. Through this team, I've met many friends, learned new skills, and had experiences that I believe to be invaluable.</p>

            <p>Outside of school, I enjoy spending my time playing video games and recently, I've started video editing. For my favorite game of all time, I would have to say either Titanfall 2 or Dying Light. I use a program called Da Vinci Resolve to do my video editing, as I believe it to be the best free editing software.</p>

        <div class="music">
            <p class="musictext">Unsurprisingly, I love to listen to music! I don't really have a favorite genre or favorite artist. I mostly just listen to video game OSTs (original soundtracks). Speaking of which, here's a YouTube playlist of some of my favorite video game tracks!</p>
