            <ul><strong>My life goals!</strong>
                <li>Always continue to learn. Knowledge is power.</li>
                <li>Be curious! I can't learn anything if I'm not willing to be curious and seek it out myself.</li>
                <li>Be adventurous! Maybe not like Indiana Jones, but I don't want to live my life behind a desk only working. There's a good balance of work and play that I feel the need to achieve.</li>
                <li>Give my kids a better life than I had. I was blessed with an amazing family and upbringing and have been given great opportunities and I want to give my children the chance to have the same or hopefully better. </li>
                <li>Be able to take care of my parents. They've done so much for me and I can only hope to repay the favor.</li>
            </ul>    
            </div>
            <div class="careergoals">
                <ul><strong>My career goals!</strong>
                    <li>Get a bachelor's degree. I haven't made any final decisions on college, but I'd like to attend either Purdue or Indiana University.</li>
                    <li>Find a stable job out of college and learn to provide for myself.</li>
                    <li>After getting a stable income, possibly going back to school and pursuing a master's degree. Likely going back to whichever school I originally graduated from.</li>
                    <li>Work in either the data science, cybersecurity, or software development field. My current number one choice is data science but that could change.</li>
                    <li>Develop something meaningful. I want to work for a company that is truly changing the world for the better. I don't need all the glory and fame, it's enough for me to know that I helped change the world.</li>
                </ul>
