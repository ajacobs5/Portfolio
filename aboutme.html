        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>Hey there! My name is Alexander Jacobs. I like to be called AJ. I am currently a junior at Perry Meridian High School, as well as a member of Nextech Catapult's 2021 class. I am the youngest member of my family of five, and my favorite food is buffalo chicken wings. I was first introduced to the Computer Science field through a few means. A few upperclassmen, namely Ridge Falco, got me to join the robotics team and I learned a lot there. Afterwards, I took a Computer Science 1 course and my teacher, Mrs. Towne, helped me learn a lot. She also introduced me to the world of Nextech, and I couldn't be happier that she did! I aspire to do something in the data science, software development, or cybersecurity fields, although I'm not sure which yet.</p>
