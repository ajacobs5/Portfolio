        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <div class="about">

            <p>Hey there! My name is Alexander Jacobs. I like to be called AJ. I am currently a junior at Perry Meridian High School, as well as a member of Nextech Catapult's 2021 program. I am the youngest member in my family of five, and my favorite food is buffalo chicken wings. I was first introduced to the Computer Science field through an upperclassman, Ridge Falco. He convinced me to join our school's robotics team and I learned (and continue to learn!) a lot there. Afterwards, I took a Computer Science 1 course and my teacher, Mrs. Towne, helped me learn a lot. She also introduced me to the world of Nextech, and I couldn't be happier that she did! I aspire to do something in the data science, software development, or cybersecurity fields, although I'm not sure which yet. My current coding knowledge consists of Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and very, very limited C++. As for other digital mediums, I have worked in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and also dabble in video editing. I am a hard-working individual, I love to learn, and above all else, I love to see those around me succeed.</p>
